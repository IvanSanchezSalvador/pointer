# pointer-frontend

The Vue client for my pointing poker application. Check out the server for this site over at [NathanHeffley/pointer-server](https://github.com/NathanHeffley/pointer-server).

## Work In Progress

This project is still under development. The main things to be accomplished for a confident release are...

- [ ] Display votes from other clients when joining a session (see [Issue #1](https://github.com/NathanHeffley/pointer-frontend/issues/1))

- [ ] Set up better `.env` files (see [Issue #2](https://github.com/NathanHeffley/pointer-frontend/issues/2))

- [x] Add tests
